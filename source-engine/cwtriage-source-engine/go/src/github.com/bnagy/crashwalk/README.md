Crashwalk
=======

## Documentation

If you want to use `import "github.com/bnagy/crashwalk"` in your own Go code, you
can get godoc at: http://godoc.org/github.com/bnagy/crashwalk

## cwtriage

To run the standalone cwtriage tool:
```
  cwtriage runs crashfiles with instrumentation and outputs results in various formats
  Usage: cwtriage -root /path/to/afl-dir [-match pattern] -- /path/to/target -in @@ -out whatever
  ( @@ will be substituted for each crashfile )

  -afl
      Prefer the AFL recorded crashing command, if present
  -engine string
      Debugging engine to use: [gdb lldb] (default "gdb")
  -every int
      Run every n seconds (default -1)
  -f string
      Template filename to use while running crash
  -ignore string
      Directory skip pattern ( go regex syntax )
  -match string
      Match pattern for files ( go regex syntax )
  -mem int
      Memory limit for target processes (MB) (default -1)
  -output string
      Output format to use: [json pb text] (default "text")
  -root string
      Root directory to look for crashes
  -seen
      Include seen results from the DB in the output
  -seendb string
      Path to BoltDB (default "crashwalk.db")
  -strict
      Abort the whole run if any crashes fail to repro
  -t int
      Timeout for target processes (secs) (default 60)
  -tidy
      Move crashes that error under Run() to a tidy dir
  -workers int
```

### AFL Mode

If you're using AFL >= 1.50b then afl automatically records the command that was used in each crash dir ( in the README.txt file ). For most people, that means you can use the -afl switch to:
- Automatically set the -match pattern to match AFL crashfiles
- Automatically use the stored command from the README.txt in each crash directory
- Automatically set the same memory limit
- Automatically ignore queue/ and hang/ directories
- Automatically pick up `-f` template configuration from README.txt
- Use the supplied command (if any) as a default

If you are in the directory that contains your individual fuzz workers, then the minimal command would be something like
```
cwtriage -root . -afl
```

**NOTE** See [Bugs](#bugs) below!

### Manual Mode

If you're triaging from an older version of AFL or you want to run the crashes with a different target command, then `-match crashes.\*id` should match AFL crashes.

The tool creates a BoltDB (in the current directory, by default) that is used to cache crash instrumentation results. This way you can run it multiple times on an active directory and only get the latest crashes, or run it with -seen and get all crashes, but faster. To "reset the cache" just `rm crashwalk.db`. NOTE that the cache DOES NOT contain the actual crashfile, only the metadata, so don't go deleting your crashes or anything.

### Output Formats

Supported output formats are JSON, protocol buffers or the text summary seen in the examples below. JSON and protbuf output is one crash per line, to facilitate piping that output to another process - for example to push each crash to a queue, write them to a database etc.

### Tidy

When you have crashfiles that don't repro under the debugger they are not added to the `cwtriage` cache database, which means that `cwtriage` will attempt to run then every time, even without `-seen`. If you have a lot of these files, or if they're particularly slow (such a memory eaters and hangs) then they can add a lot of time to each run. By using the `-tidy` flag, files that don't crash under the debugger will be moved to a directory called `.cwtidy` inside the crash directory.

### -f

If you have an app that expects a certain extension you can use the `-f` option, with some limitations. Because we support multiple workers, you can't specify an exact output file. Any file you specify, like `/dev/shm/blah.txt` will be used as a template, and each worker will copy the crashdata for each crash into a randomised 8 character name like `/dev/shm/fjsyvnsh.txt`, cleaning up at the end.

*NOTE* `-afl` mode will automatically do this for you if you used a `-f` option to `afl-fuzz` or `afl-launch`, so you don't need to pass this option.

## cwdump

`cwdump` summarizes crashes in a crashwalk database by major / minor stack hash. Although AFL (for example) already de-dupes crashes, bucketing summarizes those crashes by an order of magnitude or more. Crashes that bucket the same have _exactly_ the same stack contents, so they're likely (not guaranteed) to be the same bug.

Run `cwtriage` as above and then do something like
```
cwdump ./crashwalk.db > triage.txt
```

## cwfind

`cwfind` is a simple utility to output the filenames of all crashes matching a given hash. I use it in combination with `xargs` to bulk delete / move crashfiles.

```
$ cwfind a9060880abffbe2dcd5c9b4bb39c9233.0e358881a2545b216eee9aabe3723302

## Installation

1. You should follow the [instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) to
install Go, if you haven't already done so.

2. (FOR LINUX ONLY) Install the 'exploitable' tool from [here](https://github.com/jfoote/exploitable). Right now the code is expecting to find the tool at `~/src/exploitable/exploitable/exploitable.py`. If this is impossible, you can set the CW_EXPLOITABLE environment variable and it should get picked up.

3. (FOR LINUX ONLY) Make sure you have gdb in your path with `which gdb`

4. (FOR OSX ONLY) I wrote a very heavily modified mutant offspring of exploitable and one of the lldb sample tools, called `exploitaben.py`. Unless you do something unusual the `cwtriage` binary will install it as a dependency and use it for `-engine lldb`. You can check the lldb specific code [here](https://github.com/bnagy/francis)

5. (FOR OSX ONLY) Make sure lldb is installed. You might need to mess about with assorted Xcode hijinks etc.

Now, install crashwalk:
```bash
$ go get -u github.com/bnagy/crashwalk/cmd/...
```

The binaries produced are statically linked (Go just does that), so you can 'deploy' to other systems, docker containers etc by just copying them.

No overarching tests yet, sorry, it's a little fiddly to build a standalone testbed. The gdb / lldb parsers will panic if they get confused and give you the problematic input and a useful stack trace. If the input is not sensitive, use that to open an issue and I'll fix it.

`exploitaben` does have a reasonable set of tests, and you can check out [the results](https://github.com/bnagy/francis/blob/master/exploitaben/test_results/test_output.txt). I suck at python so the diffing is not automatic. I included all of the exploitable project tests as well as all the CrashWrangler tests.

### LLDB Example - summary output

For `exploitaben` I used "indicators" instead of a single classification. I'm hoping that this is more flexible and better suited to post-crash database searches and such. They're in the `Extra Data` field below, so that the crash summary protobufs are crossplatform.

## TODO

Add NSQ support. Add docker support. (j/k)

## Bugs

For `-afl` mode, README.txt files that do not contain a command separator (`--`) are not parsed correctly. The best way to work around this issue is to use a separator if launching `afl-fuzz` manually or to use [afl-launch](https://github.com/bnagy/afl-launch). Resolving this issue would mean emulating C getopt, which I am disinclined to spend time doing - patches welcome!
